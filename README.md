# Safe Drive

SafeDrive is a mobile-based application designed to detect drowsiness in motor vehicle drivers. The core of the drowsiness detection is based on machine learning using the Random Forest method. When a driver is detected to be drowsy, an alarm will sound. The detection criteria are determined by calculating the mouth aspect ratio (MAR), eye aspect ratio (EAR), and the position of the nose. This system aims to improve road safety by alerting drivers when they show signs of drowsiness.
